# Imaginy
Imaginy is a simple ruby script that changes your wallpaper daily, fetching it from the `favorites` section of https://wallhaven.cc.

There is no API involved, the page is parsed and each image is downloaded individually.
A config.data file is generated automaticaly, if you come from a diferent linux flavour you might need to change the `cmd` value in the config.

### Installation
You can schedule the script to run daily or on system startup.
